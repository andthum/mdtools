Developer's guide
*****************

Thank you for your willingness to contribute to MDTools!  Any help is
highly appreciated!

Although you certainly want to start right away, please take a while and
get familiar with the style guide this project follows.  Maintaining a
consistent code is much easier and thus more fun than maintaining a mess.

Also make yourself familiar with the philosophy and functionality of
|MDAnalysis|, because MDTools is mainly based on this package.  If not
alreay done, please take a look at the |mda_user_guide|.

.. note::

    MDTools is distributed under the |GNU_GPLv3|, version 3 (or any
    later version).  This is a copyleft license: not only is MDTools
    open-source, but all derivative work must be as well.  **Any code,
    documentation, or files that you contribute to MDTools will also be
    made available under this license**.  Be sure that you are
    comfortable with that **before** you contribute to the project.
