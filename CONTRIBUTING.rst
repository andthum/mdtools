You want to contribute to MDTools? Any help is highly appreciated! 

Please read our `developer's guide`_ at Read the Docs. If you have any questions, fell free to `open a discussion`_ on GitHub.

The developer's guide in short:
    
    * Adhere to the Zen of Python (PEP20_).
    * Follow style guide PEP8_ for code.
    * Follow the `NumPy docstring convention`_ for docstrings.
    * Make yourself familiar with MDAnalysis_.
    * Due to performancs reasons, try to avoid ``for`` loops as much as possible and instead use NumPy_ functions.
